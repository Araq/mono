SIGSEGV: Illegal storage access. (Attempt to read from nil?)

-1) Almost all parts are in place

-0.5) JVM

0) Try building something like that with Karax or React and see how much more code you would need

0) Sometimes it hangs

1) How to store state, communicate between threads

2) How to deal with bugs

3) State management

4) Plain single threaded Python/PHP script, could be used with NGinx only

5) Small memory consumption

6) How to pass server around?

7) fmt not works with objects

9) try implement it with React, with server persistence etc

10) SEO friendly and fast First Page Load, no need for JS and very small size

11) NOW - NGinx + Single Thread


Add Problems with Server Side

Redefine as higher priority
